# ItineraryManagementApp

## Overview
This app enables users to manage and filter their trips and events depending on their preferences. Each user could have several trips, and each trips could have several events. Events and trips are exclusive for each user so that an identical event in one trip or one user will not overlap with another event of another trip or user. This application provides multi-user functionality and authentication. Events could be added with images as well.
